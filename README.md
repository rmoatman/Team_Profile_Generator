## Description

This app is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a team, then generates a webpage that displays summaries for each person.

The webpage allows for easy access to team members' email addresses and github profiles.  Each team consists of one Manager and an unlimited amount of Engineers and Interns.  

A sample Team website generated by the app can be found here: [index.html](../dist/index.html)
